# Stand-up Reflection: 


1. I have talked about some ideas on how our team is going to work through the project like how we can make AI detect humans and vote out. And reasoning ideas about how AI can be prompted to not mention itself as Ai. Getting Ai to work for our project. And questions for the stakeholder. I have also put our documents onto the git pages and posted it through the email.

2. We have planned to ask questions and get feedback from our stakeholders to get the requirements. And prepare the full plan on collaborations to the project in the upcoming sprint. I have also contributed to communicating with prof. David Henry is looking forward to his email and meeting him on Monday.

3. So far we are good with planning out when and what the project decision will be started and done, we are trying to plan on meeting and project submission timeliness as we are in early start and have to go through the research on how to code the software and format it. We still have to talk to the stakeholders to get the complete idea of requirements to the project which we planned to do in the upcoming sprint.
