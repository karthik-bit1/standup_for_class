# Standup_week2:

1. Contributed with talking to Stakeholder, communicated with group member about structuring the interface, started editing requirements document, created Ghantt chat.
2. Planned to start doing research on AI module integrity to the software, frontend coding examples for the interface design and backend coding examples.
3. The technical challenges faced during the process is that multiple user edit is not being opted and bugging out authentication errors.
4. Personally I am good in being able to navigate files and directory and research process. Professionally I am consistent in keeping with deployment and creating changes and testing purposes.
